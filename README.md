# ModeloSISRedes
Exact SIS Markovian Model:<br>
The file app.R contains the graphic interface from where you can run the model. The parameters of this model are the adjacency matrix, the recovery and contagion rates and the steps of time to consider.<br>
Simulation and verification of the algorithm:<br>
The file ProcesoCompleto.py contains the comparison and verification of our SIS algorithm against the SIS Gillespie simulation algorithm.<br>
The file redConectada_JoseFlorez.m generates a random graph given the size of the network as a parameter.
